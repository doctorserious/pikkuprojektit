 The idea is to repurpose some bldc circular motors from a broken camera gimbal stabilizer to create a turret that can see and classify its targets using machine vision/motion detection.
 I stripped the motors from the gimbal, but the motor controller shield units for arduino that I ordered online haven't arrived yet, so that's on hold for the time being.
 As for the camera, OpenMV does have some pretty cool ones, but those are still quite pricey, so I might have to strip an old webcam and see how I would go about connecting that to an arduino board.
 I might have to use OpenCV for image recognition, if I go that route.
 Most of the parts for the mount and turret can be printed at fablab.
